# Task 2.3: Update All `NodeBounds` Construction Sites

## Objective
Mechanical task: add `dagre_center_x: None, dagre_center_y: None` to all `NodeBounds` construction sites that don't have dagre-derived centers.

## Location
Modify: Multiple files — search for `NodeBounds {` across the codebase

## TDD Phases

### 🔴 Red: Write Failing Tests

No new tests — this task fixes compilation errors introduced by Task 2.1.

**Expected failure:** After adding new fields to `NodeBounds`, all existing construction sites that don't include the new fields will fail to compile.

### 🟢 Green: Minimal Implementation

Search for all `NodeBounds {` and add the two new fields. Known sites:

1. `src/render/layout.rs` — `compute_layout()`, `compute_layout_direct()`, `compute_layout_dagre()`, `grid_to_draw_vertical()`, `grid_to_draw_horizontal()`
2. `src/render/shape.rs` — `render_node()` return value
3. Test files — any unit tests constructing `NodeBounds` directly

For non-dagre sites: `dagre_center_x: None, dagre_center_y: None`
For dagre sites: `dagre_center_x: Some(center_x + padding), dagre_center_y: Some(center_y + padding)` (per Task 2.2)

### 🔵 Refactor: Clean Up

- Verify `cargo build` compiles cleanly
- Run full test suite to confirm no regressions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All `NodeBounds` construction sites include new fields
- [ ] `cargo build` succeeds
- [ ] `cargo test` passes
