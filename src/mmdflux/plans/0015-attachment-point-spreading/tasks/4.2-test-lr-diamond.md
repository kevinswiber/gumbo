# Task 4.2: Test LR Diamond Multiple Outgoing Edges

## Objective
Verify that `ci_pipeline.mmd` renders the Deploy diamond's two outgoing edges at distinct attachment points.

## Location
Modify: `tests/integration.rs`

## Implementation

```rust
#[test]
fn test_ci_pipeline_diamond_spread() {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("tests/fixtures/ci_pipeline.mmd").unwrap();
    let output = render(&input, &RenderConfig::default());
    println!("{}", output);
    // The Deploy? diamond should have two outgoing edges on its right face
    // at different y-positions, one going to Staging (above) and one to Production (below)
}
```

## Context
- `ci_pipeline.mmd`: LR graph with `Deploy{Deploy?}` diamond having edges to `Staging[Staging Env]` and `Prod[Production]`
- In the current output, both edges exit from the same right-boundary point of the diamond
- After the fix, one should exit from the upper part and one from the lower part of the right face

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deploy diamond's two outgoing edges exit from different points on the right face
- [ ] The edge to Staging exits above the edge to Production (matching their target positions)
- [ ] Edge labels ("staging", "production") are still correctly rendered
