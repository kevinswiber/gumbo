# Task 4.1: Test TD/BT Overlap Cases

## Objective
Verify that `multiple_cycles.mmd` and `complex.mmd` no longer have overlapping attachment points after the fix.

## Location
Modify: `tests/integration.rs`

## Implementation

Run the fixtures and inspect the output:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_multiple_cycles_no_overlap() {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("tests/fixtures/multiple_cycles.mmd").unwrap();
    let output = render(&input, &RenderConfig::default());
    // Verify that forward edge A→B and backward edge C→A don't share
    // the same attachment column on node A
    // Verify that forward edge A→B and backward edge C→B don't share
    // the same attachment point on node B
    println!("{}", output);
    // Check that arrows are not overwritten — both ▼ and ▲ should be visible
    // on different columns around node A
}

#[test]
fn test_complex_no_overlap() {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("tests/fixtures/complex.mmd").unwrap();
    let output = render(&input, &RenderConfig::default());
    println!("{}", output);
    // The diamond "More Data?" should have distinct attachment points for
    // its incoming forward edge and outgoing backward edge
}
```

## Context
- The exact assertions depend on the rendered output format — may need to check specific cells or just visually inspect with `cargo test -- --nocapture`
- `multiple_cycles.mmd` content: `graph TD; A[Top] --> B[Middle]; B --> C[Bottom]; C --> A; C --> B`
- `complex.mmd` has a diamond node with forward and backward edges

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `multiple_cycles.mmd` renders with distinct attachment points for overlapping forward/backward edges
- [ ] `complex.mmd` renders with distinct attachment points on the diamond node
- [ ] No edge arrows are overwritten or lost
