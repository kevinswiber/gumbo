# Task 4.3: Regression Tests for Single-Edge Nodes

## Objective
Ensure that nodes with only one edge per face produce identical output to the current behavior (center attachment).

## Location
Modify: `tests/integration.rs`

## Implementation

Run the full test suite and verify no regressions:

```bash
cargo test
cargo test --test integration
```

Check key fixtures that should be unchanged:
- `tests/fixtures/simple.mmd` — basic A→B flow
- `tests/fixtures/chain.mmd` — linear chain
- `tests/fixtures/left_right.mmd` — LR direction
- `tests/fixtures/bottom_top.mmd` — BT direction
- `tests/fixtures/simple_cycle.mmd` — single backward edge

For these fixtures, the output should be identical because no node has multiple edges on the same face.

## Context
- The attachment plan only generates overrides for faces with >1 edge, so single-edge faces should route identically to before
- If any output changes, it indicates the plan is generating unnecessary overrides or the face classification is wrong
- Save current output before implementing (or compare against git baseline)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `cargo test` passes with no failures
- [ ] `simple.mmd`, `chain.mmd` render identically to pre-change output
- [ ] `left_right.mmd`, `bottom_top.mmd`, `right_left.mmd` render identically
- [ ] `simple_cycle.mmd` renders identically (single backward edge, no overlap)
- [ ] All existing integration tests pass
