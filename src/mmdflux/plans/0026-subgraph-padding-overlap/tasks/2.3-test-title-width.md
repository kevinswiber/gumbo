# Task 2.3: Test Title Width Influences Border Width

## Objective
Write a failing test that verifies borders are expanded to accommodate long titles.

## Location
Modify: `/Users/kevin/src/mmdflux-subgraphs/src/render/layout.rs` (add test)

## TDD Phases

### 🔴 Red: Write Failing Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_subgraph_bounds_expanded_for_title() {
    let input = "graph TD\nsubgraph sg1[This Is A Very Long Title]\nA --> B\nend\n";
    let flowchart = parse_flowchart(input).unwrap();
    let diagram = build_diagram(&flowchart);
    let config = RenderConfig::default();
    let layout = compute_layout(&diagram, &config);

    let bounds = layout.subgraph_bounds.values().next()
        .expect("Expected subgraph bounds");

    // Border must be wide enough for: corners (2) + "─ " (2) + title + " ─" (2)
    let min_width = "This Is A Very Long Title".len() + 6;
    assert!(
        bounds.width >= min_width,
        "Border width {} too narrow for title (need >= {})",
        bounds.width, min_width
    );
}
```

**What the failing test asserts:** Border width accommodates the full title text.
**Expected failure reason:** Current bounds computation ignores title length entirely.

### 🟢 Green: Minimal Implementation

*(Implementation is in Task 2.4.)*

### 🔵 Refactor: Clean Up

After Task 2.4, verify with different title lengths.

## Context
- See [Q3: Overlap inventory](../../../research/0019-subgraph-padding-overlap/q3-overlap-inventory.md) Issue 1 for the clipping problem
- `convert_subgraph_bounds()` currently uses `border_padding = 2` without considering title length

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Failing test written asserting border width >= title length + overhead
- [ ] Test confirmed red
