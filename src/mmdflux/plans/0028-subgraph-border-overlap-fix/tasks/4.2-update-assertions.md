# Task 4.2: Update integration test assertions

## Objective
Update any existing integration test assertions that depend on the old (overlapping) subgraph border positions, and add programmatic non-overlap checks.

## Location
Modify: `tests/integration.rs`

## TDD Phases

### 🔴 Red: Identify failing tests

Run `cargo test --test integration` and identify tests that fail because subgraph borders have moved (dagre bounds produce different positions than the member-node fallback).

### 🟢 Green: Update assertions

- Update snapshot strings or position assertions to match new border positions
- Add a general non-overlap assertion: for each pair of sibling subgraphs, verify their bounding rectangles don't intersect

### 🔵 Refactor: Clean Up

- Extract a reusable `assert_subgraphs_non_overlapping()` helper
- Ensure all subgraph fixtures have at least basic rendering assertions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Non-overlap assertions added for subgraph fixtures
- [ ] No regressions in non-subgraph tests
