# Task 9.2: Clean Up Layout Struct

## Objective
Remove any fields from the `Layout` struct and related types that are no longer populated or consumed after removing the stagger pipeline.

## Location
Modify: `src/render/layout.rs`, potentially `src/render/mod.rs`

---

## Implementation

1. Check if `grid_positions: HashMap<String, GridPos>` is used by downstream code:
   - Search for `grid_positions` in `src/render/mod.rs`, `src/render/router.rs`, `src/render/edge.rs`, `src/render/shape.rs`
   - If only the non-dagre `compute_layout()` fallback populates it and no renderer reads it, remove the field
   - If rendered code reads it, keep it

2. Check if `GridPos` type is used outside of `compute_grid_positions()` and the non-dagre path

3. Run `cargo clippy` to identify any unused fields or types automatically

4. Remove what's unused

---

## TDD Note

This is a cleanup/deletion task. No new behavior to test-drive. The discipline:
- Run `cargo test` after each removal to catch broken references
- Run `cargo clippy` to find remaining dead code

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No unused fields in Layout struct
- [ ] No unused type definitions
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] `cargo clippy` clean
- [ ] Commit: `feat(plan-0019): Phase 9 - Clean up Layout struct`
