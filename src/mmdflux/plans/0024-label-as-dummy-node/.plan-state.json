  "last_session_notes": "Session 2: Fixed critical label position bug (layer_starts mismatch — labels were snapping to node rows instead of between-node gaps). Changed transform_label_positions_direct to use node_bounds midpoint instead of layer_starts. Updated get_label_position to return WaypointWithRank. Added 6 edge case integration tests and strengthened existing fixture tests. All 394 tests pass. Task 7.3 (heuristic simplification) deferred to future work. Phase 7 complete. Plan ready for commit.",
