# Task 7.3: Simplify Heuristic Fallback Code

## Objective
With precomputed label positions working reliably, simplify or remove the heuristic label placement code that was previously the primary mechanism.

## Location
Modify: `src/render/edge.rs` — `draw_edge_label_with_tracking()`, `find_safe_label_position()`
Modify: `src/render/mod.rs` — `layout_config_for_diagram()` margin heuristics

## Approach

This is a cleanup task — only simplify code paths that are no longer the primary mechanism:

1. **Keep heuristic as fallback** for any edge case where precomputed positions fail
2. **Remove margin inflation** in `layout_config_for_diagram()` that was added to compensate for heuristic placement (Plan 0010's global spacing increase)
3. **Simplify `find_safe_label_position()`** — the shifting/probing logic is less needed when positions are layout-guaranteed
4. **Add debug logging** when heuristic fallback is used, to identify remaining cases

## Risks

- Removing too much may break edge cases not covered by tests
- The margin heuristics may serve other purposes beyond label spacing
- Some heuristic logic may still be needed for backward edges or unusual layouts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Heuristic code simplified but retained as fallback
- [ ] Unnecessary margin inflation removed
- [ ] All tests pass after simplification
- [ ] Debug logging added for heuristic fallback usage
