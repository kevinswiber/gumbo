# Task 2.2: Add `layers_sorted_by_order()` Helper

## Objective
Add a helper function that builds the layer vectors sorted by `graph.order`, needed because `rank::by_rank()` returns layers in node insertion order, not order-sorted.

## Location
Modify: `src/dagre/order.rs` (add new function)

## Implementation

```rust
/// Build layer vectors sorted by node order.
///
/// `rank::by_rank()` returns layers with nodes in insertion order.
/// This function sorts each layer by `graph.order[node]` so the
/// vectors reflect the current ordering. Used after `init_order()`
/// and needed by the adaptive loop.
fn layers_sorted_by_order(graph: &LayoutGraph) -> Vec<Vec<usize>> {
    let mut layers = rank::by_rank(graph);
    for layer in &mut layers {
        layer.sort_by_key(|&node| graph.order[node]);
    }
    layers
}
```

## Context

The sweep functions (`sweep_down`, `sweep_up`) iterate over `layers` to get the fixed and free node sets. While the `contains()` checks don't depend on vector order, having layers sorted by order ensures consistency and makes debugging easier.

This function will be called from `run()` in Phase 3 (task 3.1). For now, just add it so it compiles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `layers_sorted_by_order()` function added
- [ ] Returns layers with nodes sorted by `graph.order`
- [ ] Compiles cleanly
