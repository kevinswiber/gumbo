# Task 1.1: Add `parent` Field to `Subgraph` Struct

## Objective
Add `parent: Option<String>` to the `Subgraph` struct so downstream stages can reconstruct the subgraph hierarchy.

## Location
Modify: `src/graph/diagram.rs`

## TDD Phases

### 🔴 Red: Write Failing Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_subgraph_has_parent_field() {
    let sg = Subgraph {
        id: "inner".to_string(),
        title: "Inner".to_string(),
        nodes: vec!["A".to_string()],
        parent: Some("outer".to_string()),
    };
    assert_eq!(sg.parent, Some("outer".to_string()));
}
```

**What the failing test asserts:** The `Subgraph` struct accepts a `parent` field.
**Expected failure reason:** Field `parent` does not exist on `Subgraph`.

### 🟢 Green: Minimal Implementation

Add `pub parent: Option<String>` to the `Subgraph` struct in `diagram.rs`:

```rust
pub struct Subgraph {
    pub id: String,
    pub title: String,
    pub nodes: Vec<String>,
    pub parent: Option<String>,
}
```

Update all existing `Subgraph` construction sites to include `parent: None`:
- `src/graph/builder.rs` (line ~42)
- Any test code that constructs `Subgraph` directly

### 🔵 Refactor: Clean Up

None expected. Run all tests to confirm nothing is broken.

## Context
The `Subgraph` struct currently has `id`, `title`, and `nodes` fields. The `parent` field mirrors the existing `parent: Option<String>` on the `Node` struct (`src/graph/node.rs`).

See [Q1: Builder parent tracking](../../../research/0025-nested-subgraphs/q1-builder-parent-tracking.md) for research context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Failing test written and confirmed red
- [ ] `Subgraph` struct has `parent: Option<String>` field
- [ ] All existing tests pass with `parent: None` added to construction sites
- [ ] Code refactored with tests still green
