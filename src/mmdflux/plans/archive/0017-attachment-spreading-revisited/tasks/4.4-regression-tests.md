# Task 4.4: Regression Tests for Non-Overlapping Fixtures

## Objective

Verify that fixtures which currently render correctly continue to produce valid output after the spreading changes.

## Location

Modify: `tests/integration.rs`

## Implementation

Run the full test suite (`cargo test`) and verify all existing tests pass. Additionally, visually spot-check key fixtures:

```bash
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/simple.mmd
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/chain.mmd
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/complex.mmd
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/simple_cycle.mmd
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/multiple_cycles.mmd
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/diamond_fan.mmd
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/ci_pipeline.mmd
cargo run -q -- tests/fixtures/left_right.mmd
```

## Context

- Single-edge faces should produce identical output to before since `compute_attachment_plan()` only generates overrides for faces with >1 edge. Single-edge faces fall through to the existing `calculate_attachment_points()` path.
- The main regression risk is in the edge sorting: if the cross-axis sort order differs from the current intersection-based order, some Z-path shapes may change slightly. This should be cosmetic, not functional.
- `multiple_cycles.mmd` and `complex.mmd` were the original plan 0015 targets. After stagger preservation, they render correctly. Verify they still do after spreading changes.
- `ci_pipeline.mmd` has diamond nodes with multiple outgoing edges. Verify the diamond rendering is unaffected.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cargo test` passes (all existing tests green)
- [ ] `simple.mmd`, `chain.mmd` render identically to before
- [ ] `complex.mmd`, `multiple_cycles.mmd`, `simple_cycle.mmd` have no regression
- [ ] `diamond_fan.mmd`, `ci_pipeline.mmd` have no diamond rendering regression
- [ ] `left_right.mmd` has no LR direction regression
