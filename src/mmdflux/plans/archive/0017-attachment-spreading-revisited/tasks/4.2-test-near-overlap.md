# Task 4.2: Test Near-Overlap Fixtures

## Objective

Add integration tests for the three single-space-gap near-overlap fixtures, verifying improved spacing after spreading.

## Location

Modify: `tests/integration.rs`

## Implementation

```rust
#[test]
fn skip_edge_collision_no_overlap() {
    let output = render_fixture("skip_edge_collision.mmd");
    assert_no_adjacent_arrows(&output, "skip_edge_collision.mmd");
}

#[test]
fn fan_in_no_overlap() {
    let output = render_fixture("fan_in.mmd");
    assert_no_adjacent_arrows(&output, "fan_in.mmd");
}

#[test]
fn five_fan_in_no_overlap() {
    let output = render_fixture("five_fan_in.mmd");
    assert_no_adjacent_arrows(&output, "five_fan_in.mmd");
}
```

## Context

- These fixtures originally had single-space gaps (`▼ ▼`) rather than zero-gap overlap. The spreading should increase the gap further, but the minimum test is that adjacent arrows (`▼▼`) don't appear.
- For `five_fan_in.mmd` with 5 edges into a narrow node, the spreading may only achieve minimal separation. The test asserts no adjacent arrows, which is achievable even on tight nodes since `spread_points_on_face()` guarantees distinct positions.
- A stricter test (asserting >= 2-character gaps) could be added as a follow-up, but for now the "no adjacent arrows" test captures the core improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tests for `skip_edge_collision.mmd`, `fan_in.mmd`, `five_fan_in.mmd`
- [ ] Each test verifies no `▼▼` in the output
- [ ] All three tests pass after the spreading implementation
