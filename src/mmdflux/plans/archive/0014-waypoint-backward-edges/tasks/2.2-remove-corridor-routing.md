# Task 2.2: Remove Corridor Routing Functions

## Objective

Remove the corridor-based backward edge routing functions from `router.rs` now that backward edges are routed through waypoints.

## Location

Modify: `src/render/router.rs`

## Implementation

Delete the following three functions entirely:

### 1. `route_backward_edge()` (lines 546-561)
```rust
// DELETE entire function
fn route_backward_edge(
    edge: &Edge,
    from_bounds: &NodeBounds,
    to_bounds: &NodeBounds,
    layout: &Layout,
    diagram_direction: Direction,
) -> Option<RoutedEdge> { ... }
```

### 2. `route_backward_edge_vertical()` (lines 569-628)
```rust
// DELETE entire function
fn route_backward_edge_vertical(
    edge: &Edge,
    from_bounds: &NodeBounds,
    to_bounds: &NodeBounds,
    layout: &Layout,
    _diagram_direction: Direction,
) -> Option<RoutedEdge> { ... }
```

### 3. `route_backward_edge_horizontal()` (lines 634-687)
```rust
// DELETE entire function
fn route_backward_edge_horizontal(
    edge: &Edge,
    from_bounds: &NodeBounds,
    to_bounds: &NodeBounds,
    layout: &Layout,
    _diagram_direction: Direction,
) -> Option<RoutedEdge> { ... }
```

These functions are approximately lines 542-687. After deletion, `route_all_edges()` and `route_edge()` remain — they no longer call any of these deleted functions (Task 2.1 already removed the call).

## Context

- After Task 2.1, `route_edge()` no longer calls `route_backward_edge()`. These functions are dead code.
- The functions reference `layout.backward_edge_lanes`, `layout.backward_corridors`, and `layout.corridor_width` which will be removed from the `Layout` struct in Task 3.1. Removing these functions first prevents compilation errors when the fields are removed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All three corridor routing functions are deleted
- [ ] No remaining references to `route_backward_edge` in the codebase
- [ ] Code compiles (the Layout struct still has corridor fields at this point — that's fine, they're just unused)
