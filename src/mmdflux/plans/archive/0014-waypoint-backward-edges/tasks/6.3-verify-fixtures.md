# Task 6.3: Run Full Test Suite and Verify Fixtures

## Objective

Run the complete test suite, verify all cycle-containing fixtures render correctly, and do a manual comparison of backward edge rendering before and after.

## Location

No file changes — this is a verification task.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Run full test suite

```bash
cargo test
```

All tests must pass. If any fail, fix them before proceeding.

### Step 2: Run integration tests specifically

```bash
cargo test --test integration
```

### Step 3: Manually verify cycle-containing fixtures

Run each fixture and visually inspect that backward edges are present and sensible:

```bash
cargo run -- tests/fixtures/simple_cycle.mmd
cargo run -- tests/fixtures/multiple_cycles.mmd
cargo run -- tests/fixtures/complex.mmd
```

For each fixture, verify:
- All nodes are rendered
- Forward edges have correct arrows
- Backward edges are visible and have correct arrow direction
- No characters overlap incorrectly
- Canvas dimensions are reasonable (no extra corridor space on the right)

### Step 4: Verify all 4 directions with a cycle

```bash
echo 'graph TD
A --> B
B --> C
C --> A' | cargo run

echo 'graph BT
A --> B
B --> C
C --> A' | cargo run

echo 'graph LR
A --> B
B --> C
C --> A' | cargo run

echo 'graph RL
A --> B
B --> C
C --> A' | cargo run
```

### Step 5: Run clippy

```bash
cargo clippy
```

Fix any warnings, especially unused variable/field warnings from the corridor removal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cargo test` passes (all unit + integration tests)
- [ ] All cycle-containing fixtures render without panics
- [ ] Backward edges are visible in output for each fixture
- [ ] All 4 layout directions work with backward edges
- [ ] `cargo clippy` passes with no warnings
